React Calculator Interview Test Application

Duration: 1-4h

Description:

Create a simple react application with the following mathematical operators: add, substract, multipy and divide. The application must be usable by interacting with the UI components and by keyboard input, it should also use redux to control it's state and to store a history of calculator operations.

The keyboard events should be available independent of the current focused element, try not to use an input element to make this work.

Bonus: Add some snapshot tests using a test runner of your choice.
